# Spring_boot

> *Personal Spring Boot practice / learning code — for reference & future use*

##  What is this

This repository contains my personal experiments and practice code built using Spring Boot (Java).
The main goal is to try out different features / patterns, brush up on Spring Boot basics, and keep a referenceable code-base for future projects.
This is **not** meant as a production-ready application — think of it as a sandbox / learning ground.

##  What you’ll find here

* Simple Spring Boot applications (REST endpoints, controllers, basic services)
* Sample CRUD operations (if any) — just for practice
* Configuration & setup examples (dependencies, project structure, packaging)
* Code written by me as I learn different Spring Boot features

*(Feel free to expand this list depending on what you have — e.g. web controllers, data access, DTOs, authentication, config examples, etc.)*

## 🛠️ Getting Started / How to run (for your future self or others)

Here’s a typical way to run the projects in this repo:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo  
git clone https://github.com/Zaidshaikh2811/Spring_boot.git

# 2. Import/open in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse)  
#    Make sure you have Java and Maven (or Gradle) installed

# 3. Build the project  
mvn clean install     # or use your preferred build command

# 4. Run the application  
mvn spring-boot:run   # or run the main class from your IDE

# 5. (Optional) Explore / modify code — use as reference or base for future projects
```

>  Since this is a learning repo — configuration (dependencies, settings) may be minimal/basic. Adjust as needed when reusing.

## 🔍 What this repo is — and isn't

###  What this repo *is*

* A learning / practice playground for Spring Boot features
* A reference base — easy to revisit when you start a new Spring Boot project
* Simple and minimal — no complicated production concerns

### What this repo *is not*

* Not a production-ready application
* Not optimized for performance, security, or scalability
* Not feature-complete or polished — just practice code

##  Why I built this

* To get hands-on practice with Spring Boot fundamentals
* To experiment and learn project structure, dependencies, configuration, and basic patterns
* To keep a code base I can refer to when starting real projects in the future

##  Who is this for

* For **me** — as a personal reference / learning archive
* For **you (future me or other developers)** — if you want to quickly see working Spring Boot examples / boilerplate
* For **beginners** — if someone wants a simple starting point to understand how a Spring Boot app is structured

##  (Optional) What you could add / improve later

* More modules / features (e.g. database integration, DTOs, validation, error handling)
* Documentation/comments inside code
* Config profiles (e.g. dev / prod)
* Unit / integration tests
* Project-level README updates describing new modules or functionality

##  Notes & Disclaimer

* This is purely for practice; treat the code accordingly
* I may reuse parts of this for future projects — structure or code may change over time
* If you clone or reuse — check dependencies / configurations before using
